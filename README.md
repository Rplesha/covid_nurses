# covid_nurses
Application for checking the last time a given nurse had a covid patient. A charge nurse opens up the app and the first screen is date-stamped, so all the charge nurse needs to do is input a nurse's name to see the last time they had a covid patient. The app should do the rest of the work.

## Requirements:
- show each nurse (order of 100 nurses)
- show when the last time they had a covid patient 
- ablity to easily update daily
- no patient information
